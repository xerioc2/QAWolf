My solution to their assessment(looking for any improvement tips so if I do this again can do a better job

Got my rejection letter... so time to start working on this and applying what they said before I resubmit.

"Hi Michael, 

Thank you so much for taking the time to complete our assessment and for your interest in QA Wolf. We truly appreciate the effort you put into your submission.
After careful consideration, we've decided not to move forward with your application at this time. This was a difficult decision, as we received a number of strong submissions, and ultimately chose candidates whose work was a closer match to what we're currently looking for.
That said, your submission showed promise and solid foundational work. In case you choose to reapply in the future, we wanted to share a couple of suggestions that could help your next submission stand out:
•	Consider adding advanced features such as a user interface, robust error handling, or detailed reporting to demonstrate deeper technical implementation.
•	Aim to go beyond the basic requirements and incorporate creative or innovative touches that help your work stand out.
We recognize this process can be challenging, and we want to emphasize that we see potential in your work. If you'd like to apply again, we welcome reapplications after a six-month window to ensure fairness to all candidates.  

Thanks again for your time and effort. We wish you all the best in your continued career journey and hope to see your name again in the future! 

Sincerely, 
The QA Wolf Hiring Team
